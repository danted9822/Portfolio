              <p>I am passionate about building excellent software that improves
              the lives of those around me. Some info about me. I like to spend my 
              free time with different activities such as jogging, reading, playing computer games, 
              listening to music, hangging out with my friends.
              In the future I would like to work as a Junior Full-Stack Developer.</p>
